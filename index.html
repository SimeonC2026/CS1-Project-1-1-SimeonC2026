<div id="Chicken Nuggets">
  <h2>Chicken Nuggets</h2>
  <img src="Chicken Nuggets.jpg" width="300px">
  
  <h3>Description</h3>
  <P>I have been having these since 2012 and I really like those. I mostly had those every Friday evening for dinner with my family and friends. I have also been having them for lunch as well. They are homemade and delicious!</P>
  
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
  <li>400 grams of chicken breast fillets</li>
  <li>4 tbsp buckwheat flour</li>
  <li>1 lightly beaten egg</li>
  <li>115g gluten free breadcrumbs or other dried breadcrumbs</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons of coconut oil</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
  <li>Cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces and then place them between two layers of baking paper.</li>
  <li>Use a rolling pin to gently flatten the pieces until they are around 2-3mm thick and uniform.</li>
  <li>Tip the flour onto a plate and mix it with a pinch of salt. Put the beaten egg in a bowl, and tip the breadrumbs into another bowl. For the air fryer method, lightly oil a large baking tray.</li>
  <li>Dip each chicken piece in the flour, then into the egg (no excess), and finally toss in the breadcrumbs.</li>
  <li>Transfer coated chicken pieces to a lightly oiled baking tray for the oven method or air fryer basket for air fryer method. Breadcrumbing using one hand is less messy.</li>
  <li>If you are using the oven, not pan-frying, preheat it to to 400‚Ñâ. Bake nuggets for 10-15 minutes, turning them halfway through to prevent them getting burnt.</li>
  <li>If you decide to use the air-fryer, brush chicken pieces with oil on both sides. Cook the nuggets in batches in the air-fryer basket for 5 minutes per batch until golden and crunchy.</li>
  <li>Shake basket halfway through to ensure even cooking.</li>
  <li>When the chicken nuggets are ready, you can serve them with tomato sauce or tomato ketchup, if you want to.</li>

    <img src="Muffins.jpg" width="300px">
    
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <P>I love chocolate muffins. I have been having them since 2021 and I get to eat these types of muffins for dessert in the evening and as a snack in the afternoons.</P>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>125g almond flour</li>
    <li>25g cocoa powder</li>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350‚Ñâ.</li>
    <li>Line a muffin tin with 6 muffin cases.</li>
    <li>Sieve the flour, coca and baking powder into a medium bowl. Mix together the egg, sugar, oil and milk together in a jug, then gradually pour them into the dry ingredients (add chocolate chips now to make double chocolate muffins, if you like) and mix until combined.</li>

  <div id="Seeded Bread">
    <h2>Seeded Bread</h2>
    <img src="Seeded Bread.jpg" 
    width="200px">
  <h3>Description</h3>
<p>I like this meal because it is super healthy, high in fiber, and low in carbs. I have been having it since October 2022, and I normally eat it for breakfast in the mornings before I go to school.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>1 cup of Sunflower Seeds (raw and plain with no added oil or salt)</li>
<li> 1/2 cup Pumpkin Seeds (raw without added oil or salt, also known as pepitas)</li>
<li>1/2 cup Flaxseeds (must be ground, not whole)</li>
<li>2 tbsp Chia Seeds (white or black)</li>
<li>3 tbsp Psyllium Husk Powder</li>
<li>Sweetener - dried cranberries or cherries (optional)</li>
<li>1 1/2 cups water</li>
<li>3 tbsp coconut oil</li>
<li>1 tbsp maple syrup</li>


</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
<li>Preheat the oven to 350‚Ñâ.</li>
  <li>Mix all of the dry ingredients together.</li>
<li>Mix the wet ingredients and stir them into the dry ingredients.</li>
<li>Add the mixture into the lined loaf pan and leave overnight. 
  <li>Pop the bread into the oven and bake for 20 minutes and then remove the part baked loaf from the loaf pan. Quick Tip: Do not skip lining the loaf pan with parchment paper. Parchment paper makes it super easy to lift the bread out of the pan after 20 minutes.</li>
<li>Put the loaf which should now hold together without the paper or loaf pan back into the oven on the oven rack for 40 minutes. Once the baking is finished, lift the bread out of the pan and let it cool on a rack for at least 1 hour before slicing.</li>
